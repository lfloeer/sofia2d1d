Implementation of 2D-1D Wavelet De-noising for SoFiA

The function sofia2d1d.sourcefinder.denoise_2d1d
------------------------------------------------

The scale parameters (`xy_scales` and `z_scales`) determine, how many scales are used during reconstruction of the data.
The scales should be chosen in a way to capture all scales that contain source signal but not more.
